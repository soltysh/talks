## Front end

We will start deploying our application from the top, since this is the least
pythonic part of this workshop and we want to focus on python here ;-), right?

### Getting started

The easiest way to deploy any application on OpenShift is to use `oc new-app`.
This will create all the necessary resources needed to build and/or run your
application. We will use the following command to create our front end:

[source]
----
oc new-app \
    soltysh/lighttpd-centos7~https://github.com/soltysh/blast.git \
    --context-dir=ui \
    --name=ui \
    --labels=app=ui
----

Let us break this command into pieces, since there is a lot happening in here:

- `soltysh/lighttpd-centos7` - builder image (iow. build environment) for the
application. You can read about how to create your own builder in the
link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/creating_images/s2i.html[official docs],
or check out my link:https://blog.openshift.com/create-s2i-builder-image/[blog post]
where I describe how this particular image was made.
- `https://github.com/soltysh/blast.git` - is the repository with our
application.
- `--context-dir=ui` - the entire application is kept inside a single
repository, where each directory serves as one component.  This flag states
that the front end is inside the `ui` directory.
- `--name` - forces to use specific name for all the resources being
created.  Otherwise `oc new-app` will use the repository name.
- `--labels=app=ui` - assign label `app` with value `ui` to all the created
resources.

As a result of the above invocation OpenShift will create the following
resources.

### Image Stream


link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/managing_images.html[Image stream]
is a virtual view of related images. It is important to note that an Image
Stream does not contain the actual image data, just its metadata. This provides
a stable pointer to an external (or internal) image, ensuring that your
application will not break unexpectedly. You can read more about them in my
recent link:https://blog.openshift.com/image-streams-faq/[blog post].

You can view Image Stream details using CLI, or check out __Builds__ -> __Images__
from the menu (on the right) in the web console:

[source]
----
oc describe is/lighttpd-centos7
----

### Build Configuration

link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/builds/index.html[Build configuration]
describes the build process and all the parameters needed to perform one.
OpenShift support the following build strategies:

- link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[Source To Image (S2I)] - produces
ready to run images by injecting application source code into a
container image with a pre-configured build and runtime environment.
- link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#pipeline-build[Pipeline] - allows
developers to define a link:https://jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/[Jenkins Pipeline].
- link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#docker-build[Docker build] - runs
plain `docker build` command.
- link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#custom-build[Custom build] - allows
developers to define a specific builder image responsible for the entire
build process.

To view the details of a `BuildConfig` object you can use `oc describe bc/ui`,
or check __Builds__ -> __Builds__ in the web console.

image::buildconfig.png[Build Config]

We will look in details into S2I build process for python application in the
next section when we will be building python back ends for our search engine.

### Deployment Configuration

link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/deployments/how_deployments_work.html[Deployment configuration]
provides a fine-grained management over user application. Under the covers
they use three separate API objects:

. A deployment configuration, which describes the desired state of a particular component of the application as a pod template.
. One or more Replication Controllers, which contain a point-in-time record of the state of a deployment configuration as a pod template.
. One or more Pods, which represent an instance of a particular version of an application.

OpenShift supports three strategies, which allow implementing wide range of
deployment strategies you are all familiar with:

- link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.html#rolling-strategy[Rolling] - slowly
replaces instances of previous version of an application with the new version.
- link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.html#recreate-strategy[Recreate] - scales
the previous version of an application down to zero and only then brings up the
new version.
- link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/deployments/deployment_strategies.html#custom-strategy[Custom] - allowing
one to implement his own flavor of deployment.

To view the details of a `DeploymentConfig` object you can use `oc describe dc/ui`,
or check __Aplications__ -> __Deployments__ in the web console.

image::deploymentconfig.png[Deployment Config]

### Service

link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.html[Service]
provides a stable access point under which the service is reachable,
since the Pods
link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/#durability-of-pods-or-lack-thereof[come and go].

To view the details of a `Service object you can use `oc describe svc/ui`,
or check __Aplications__ -> __Services__ in the web console.

image::service.png[Service]

### Routes

So far we have set up the build and deployment processes and exposes the
application internally. The final piece of the puzzle is the Route.
link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/routes.html[Route], like it
was previously mentioned, exposes the Service to the outside world under given
hostname. To do that we will use the following command:

[source]
----
oc expose svc/ui
----

Alternatively, we can use the web console, when viewing Service details click
__Action__ -> __Create Route__:

image::route.png[Route]

This will expose our React front end under `https://ui-<project>.{{ROUTER_ADDRESS}}`,
where `<project>` will reflect the project name you created earlier.

### Probes

Now that our application is up and running and most importantly exposed to the
external world we want to leverage platform capabilities of self-healing.
For that purpose, we are going to define link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/application_health.html[liveness and readiness]
checks for our application.

[NOTE]
====
Liveness - verifies the pod is healthy, iow. running, when this fails
the scheduler will restart the container.

Readiness - checks whether your application is ready to accept
requests, iow. when it can accept traffic.
====

Actually, some of you might already noticed the following warning in the web
console (specifically on the overview page and in the deployment configuration
preview):

image::health_warning.png[Health Warning]

Clicking that link will give us a page where we can configure both of the
aforementioned checks:

image::liveness_probe.png[Liveness Probe]

image::readiness_probe.png[Readiness Probe]

Alternatively, we can use the CLI to do the same:

[source]
----
oc set probe dc/ui --liveness --open-tcp=8080
oc set probe dc/ui --readiness --get-url=http://:8080/
----

Here, we are setting the liveness probe to open port `8080`, which is our link:https://www.lighttpd.net/[lighttpd server].
This is additionally accompanied with `HTTP GET` operation to verify the
application is up and ready for serving requests.
