## Accessing OpenShift

OpenShift is a multi tenant system capable of supporting multiple users at
the same time. To do anything within an OpenShift environment you must
first login. Once you have access, before you can deploy any application,
you must also have a project to deploy it into.

In this set of exercises you will login into the OpenShift environment and
create a project to work in.

### Logging in from the command line

In order to login using the `oc` command line client, run the command:

[source]
----
oc login {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}
----

You may see the following output:

[source]
----
The server uses a certificate signed by an unknown authority.
You can bypass the certificate check, but any data you send to the server could be intercepted by others.
Use insecure connections? (y/n):
----

The reason you received this message is because the OpenShift environment
being used for this workshop is using a self-signed certificate. In a
real-world scenario, either OpenShift's certificate would be signed by a
standard CA (eg: Thawte, Verisign, StartSSL, etc.) or signed by a
corporate-standard CA that you already have installed on your system.

Respond with `Y` to accept the use of the self signed certificate and
continue.

[NOTE]
====
On some versions of Microsoft Windows, you may get an error that the server
has an invalid x.509 certificate. If you receive this error, use the
following command instead:

[source]
----
oc login {{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}} --insecure-skip-tls-verify=true
----
====

Once you issue the `oc login` command, you will be prompted for the user
name and password.

Enter in the credentials for your assigned user account:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
Username: userXX
Password: userXX
----

When you have been authenticated successfully, you will see the following
confirmation message:

[source]
----
Login successful.

You don't have any projects. You can try to create a new project, by running

    oc new-project <projectname>
----

### Creating a new project

link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/projects.html[Projects] are
a top level concept to help you organize your deployments. An OpenShift
project allows a community of users (or a single user) to organise and manage
their content in isolation from other communities.

Each project can have its own resources, policies (who can or cannot
perform actions), and constraints (quotas and limits on resources, etc).

Projects act as a "wrapper" around all the application services and
endpoints you (or your teams) are using for your work.

Before you can deploy the Python web application used in this workshop, you
need to create a new project in which to deploy it. As you are working in a
shared OpenShift environment, you need to use a unique name for your
project. Create a new project which incorporates your user name by running:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
oc new-project project-userXX
----

You should see the following message to confirm the creation of the project.

[source]
----
Now using project "project-userXX" on server "https://{{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app centos/ruby-22-centos7~https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git

to build a new example application in Ruby.
----

### Logging into the web console

In addition to the command line client, OpenShift ships with a web console.
The web console provides you with the ability to perform many common tasks
as well as get a visual overview of the applications you have deployed.

To login to the web console for the OpenShift environment used in this
workshop, visit the URL:

*link:https://{{CONSOLE_ADDRESS}}[]*

As with logging in from the command line, you may get an error due to the
use of a self signed certificate. Add an exception to allow the browser to
communicate with the web site. The first screen you should then see will be
the user authentication screen.

Enter in the credentials for your assigned user account:

[source,role=copypaste]
----
Username: userXX
Password: userXX
----

After you have authenticated to the web console, you will be presented with
a list of projects that your user has permission to work with. You should be
able to see the project you created above from the command line.

image::project_list.png[Project List]

Click on the project you created and you should be taken to the project
overview page.

The overview page will list details about any applications you have
deployed in the project. As you haven't yet deployed any application, there
is nothing to display and the overview page will prompt you to add an
application. Don't select it just yet, we will get to deploying an
application later.

If metrics have been enabled in the OpenShift environment being used for
this workshop, because a self signed certificate is being used, you will
see a message indicating that an error occurred getting metrics.

image::enable_metrics.png[Enable Metrics]

Click on the the link that says __Open metrics URL__, and add an exception
for the certificate. This will enable any charts for metrics to be
displayed in the web console.

In the remainder of this workshop you will be using both the command line
and the web console interchangeably.

### Introduction to CLI

A rule of thumb, every command in the CLI world will take the following from:

[source]
----
oc <verb> <resource>/<name>
----

where:

- `verb` is one of: `get`, `set`, `describe`, etc. You can run `oc help` to
get a full list.
- `resource` is one of resources supported by the platform (or its alias),
  this includes `DeploymentConfig` (or `dc`), `BuildConfig` (`bc`),
  `ImageStream` (`is`), `Service` (`svc`), etc. When bash completions are
  installed, running `oc get` + `<tab>` will give you a list of available
  resource names.
- `name` is the resource name given by the user.

Each of the commands can additionally contain flags, see `oc <verb> --help`
to get the list of all supported flags.
