# Getting the Jobs Done With Kubernetes


## Detailed abstract

When you hear words such as Kubernetes or OpenShift you immediately start thinking
about long running processes you can easily scale at will. However, the latest
versions of OpenShift include a lesser known feature which allows you to run pretty
much anything from simple tasks up to highly-complicated ones.

During this presentation, the author of the Job resource in Kubernetes and OpenShift
will guide you through several techniques for performing anything ranging from simple
Pi calculations to rendering a movie. No matter if you're a data scientist running
large scale calculations across several data centers or a hobby programmer running
simple day-to-day tasks, this presentation is to teach you how to efficiently use
Kubernetes and OpenShift Jobs on their own or as the building blocks of something
bigger.

This presentation will feature a number of live demos to help illustrate the various
ways that you can put Jobs to work. Donâ€™t miss out on learning about one of the
most powerful new features of OpenShift!
